High Level Definitions
Repository - Container for a project
Branch - Work on different versions in a repository
Commit  - Saving Changes - Each commit is a separate unit of change that can be rolled back
Pull/Pull Request - Proposing changes to another branch like master
Merge - Push changes from pull into another branch like master

High level workflow
1. Create repository, put any existing code in the master branch
2. Create a branch to work on changes
3. Make changes in the branch with commits
4. Open a pull request to have commits reviewed
5. Deploy from the branch for testing changes
6. Merge changes from branch into master, taking the changes into production.

VS Code notes
1. Commits are local, they arent published to Github until a sync is performed
2. Each commit is a point in time that can be rolled back. They dont have to occur every single time the file is changed.
    Only perform after a series of changes have been made. Commits act as cloud backups. 
    Good idea to commits such that you don't lose work if the local copy gets corrupted.

Testing - The pull and merge to master were succesful. These are additional updates as we continue woorking on the feature branch updates.
